            <p>"The Cisco Binary Game is the best way to learn and practice the binary number system. It is great for classes, students and teachers in 
science, math, digital electronics, computers, programming, logic and networking. It is also a LOT of fun to play for anyone who likes to 
play fast-paced arcade games." - Cisco</p>
